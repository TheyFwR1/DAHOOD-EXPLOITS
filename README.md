# RD AND R1'S HUB OF EXPLOITS

All these scripts are supported by almost all executors. 
Executors that are 100% supported and that have been tested are: 

KRNL : https://krnl.place/ 

SYNAPSE X (paid): https://x.synapse.to/

SCRIPT WARE: https://script-ware.com/

FLUXUS: https://fluxteam.net/

TRIGON: https://trigonevo.com/

pretty much any paid executor or any TRUSTED free executor 

Most of my scripts will be dahood locks, antilocks, aimviewers and antilock resolvers. 

MOST SCRIPTS ARE NOT MADE BY ME AND I DO NO CLAIM TO OWN THEM!
